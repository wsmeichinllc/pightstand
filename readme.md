### Notes

#### General Principles

+  write code in python
+  cache data from unreliable sources
+  use in-memory filesystem (`/dev/shm`) for temporary files to prevent wear of the SD card
+  use JSON to format data at rest
+  create separate programs for each task (_a la_ microservices)
+  leverage OS-level tools (`bash`, `cron`, `cal`) where appropriate


#### papirus-temp

This is a shell script that reads the on-board temperature sensor.  
This provides the board temperature, which is regularly higher than the room temperature, and not much use to this application.  
This is also [available in the vendor repo](https://github.com/PiSupply/PaPiRus/blob/master/bin/papirus-temp.sh), although it's been replaced by a python script.

#### papiswitch

This is a python program that monitors the buttons on the PaPiRus Screen HAT:

+  checks a PID file to make sure it's not already running
+  event loop waits for keypress
+  keypress is [de-bounced](https://www.arduino.cc/en/tutorial/debounce)
+  first detected [WeMo plug](https://www.belkin.com/us/p/P-F7C063/) is toggled
+  quits on error

A cron job relaunches this every minute.  
Sometimes it fails to toggle the light, and I haven't started to debug it.  
Killing the process (also power-cycling the raspberry pi) generally clears this up.  
It's been suggested that I squirt XML directly to its IP address and skip the library, but I'd rather understand what's going on.  
This will need to support more WeMo devices in the near future.

#### papirus-image

This is a python program that loads the image on the e-ink display once it is generated by `papigen`, below.

+  Full refresh on boot (timestamp file missing)
+  Full refresh at top of hour (flashes screen, takes longer)
+  Partial refresh all other times

#### papigen

This is the core, pulling together various data and formatting the display.  This is also executed via cron every minute.

+  polls my thermostat for current house temperature
+  polls [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/api) every twenty minutes for outside temperature near me
+  executes the GNU [cal](https://www.gnu.org/software/gcal/) utility to generate current month calendar
+  creates bitmap image for loading to display

#### crontab

```
# m h  dom mon dow   command
* * * * * [ -x bin/papigen ] && bin/papigen && bin/papirus-image >/dev/null 2>&1 
* * * * * [ -x bin/papiswitch ] && bin/papiswitch > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```
